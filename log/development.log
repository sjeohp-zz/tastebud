Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 5343e6b06a6f73c245020000.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5343e6b06a6f73c245020000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5343e6b06a6f73c245020000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 5348ba0d6a6f73e2d8000000.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5348ba0d6a6f73e2d8000000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5348ba0d6a6f73e2d8000000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFieldOption (
Problem:
  Invalid option :index provided for field :key.
Summary:
  Mongoid requires that you only provide valid options on each field definition in order to prevent unexpected behaviour later on.
Resolution:
  When defining the field :key on 'Tag', please provide valid options for the field. These are currently: as, default, identity, label, localize, metadata, pre_processed, subtype, type, overwrite. If you meant to define a custom field option, please do so first like so:

   Mongoid::Fields.option :index do |model, field, value|
     # Your logic here...
   end
   class Tag
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :key, index: true
   end
